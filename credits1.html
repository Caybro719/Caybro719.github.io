        <h3>Created on Sunday, 2nd of March</h3>
        <p>I want to start off by thanking Mr Jacobson. Without his help in building my website, I wouldn't have gotten 
            very far and I would probally have no intrest in html or css. Thank you so much for your kindness and patience 
            during your computer science class in Pebble Beach Code Camp! I hope I will meet you again soon!
