                started when Adolf Hitler grew tired of the debt that Germany had to return to the allies for their costs in World War 1 and had planned to expand
                the Great Germany throughout the whole of Europe. As a result, this led to the spark of ignition for the declarance of war declared by the 
                British Empire and France. In just a year after the declarance of war against Nazi Germany and her allies, the Nazis have gain control of almost 
                the entirety of Europe the following, France, Belgium, Netherlands, Denmark, Romania, Austria-Hungray, Lichenstein and many more other countries to name.

                began to fight in North Africa, marking the North Africa campaign in which Rommel enters as a cool-looking general with his stunning tactics and manpower. In the summer of 
                1943, the Allies attacked Scily which started the rebellion against Mussolini, the man behind Axis Italy. Soon after in 1944, D-Day had commenced. It was a 
                stunning world record with over 150,000 troops boarding the shores of Normandy, the area where the Allies attacked. The Allies soon liberated France and histroy would witness 
                the last stand of the Nazi German Power as the Battle of the Bulge halted the Allies liberation but not for long as soon the Allies pushed back Nazi Germany along with the USSR 
                at the east and the Americans and the British Empire at the west, Nazi Germany wasn't looking too good. Then soon after, Hitler suicided marking the end of the Western theatre. After
